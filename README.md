 Hi, welcome!

I am Prince, I spend my time improving myself as a mobile engineer and working as an industrial-level developer for different teams like [AMI, TechArmy, and Ewoindustry] and also keeping up to date with the World and new coding technologies.

Flutter/Dart - Git - Java - Kotlin - XML - GPT.

I find lifestyle as one more thing I talk about and improve.
